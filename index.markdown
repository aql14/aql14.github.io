title: "Burglary in SF: COVID-19 impact"
---

This project presents an exploration of crime patterns in San Francisco, based on public data released by the cityâ€™s police department. The dataset includes thousands of reported incidents, detailing the type of crime, date and time, police district, and geographic location.

Through a series of visualizations, the project highlights how crime varies across neighborhoods and time periods. The goal is to provide a clear, engaging narrative that helps readersâ€”whether researchers, residents, or casual visitorsâ€”understand the broader trends and dynamics of urban crime in San Francisco.
